  $ scalac \*.scala

## Run the chat server
Then run chat server, e.g. on host 9000:

## Run clients
Attach (named) client(s) to running server:
  
  $ scala pl.chyla.chat.Client <ip> <port> <client name>

  $ scala pl.chyla.chat.Client localhost 9000 cli\_one
  $ scala pl.chyla.chat.Client localhost 9000 cli\_two

Typing commands on a client is logged on server and visible to other clients.
